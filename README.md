# Project Tracker: Project Management System using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)

Project Tracker is a user-friendly web application designed to help individuals and teams effectively manage their projects and tasks. It allows users to create projects, add and update tasks, assign deadlines, and track progress in real-time, improving organization and productivity.

Built with the MERN stack, Project Tracker uses MongoDB for flexible data storage, Express.js and Node.js to handle backend logic and APIs, and React.js for a dynamic, responsive frontend. Tailwind CSS and Headless UI provide clean styling and UI components, while Axios manages communication between frontend and backend.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:  
   - Run `npm install` in both `/backend` and `/frontend` directories.

2. Configure environment variables:  
   - In `/backend`, create a `.env` file with:  
     `MONGODB_PATH=your-mongodb-connection-url`

3. Run the project:  
   - Start backend server: `npm run serve` (from `/backend`)  
   - Start frontend app: `npm run start` (from `/frontend`)
